# Motivation
Within rapid development of E-Commerce during pandemic, timely construction of industrial warehouses is essential. 
A precise model for estimating construction time ensures efficient planning and resource allocation, vital for meeting the demands of rapidly growing online retail. 
With accurate projections, businesses can strategize their supply chain management effectively, optimizing delivery schedules and customer satisfaction. 
Additionally, timely completion of warehouses facilitates economic growth by attracting investments and fostering job creation in the region.

# Approach

For this challenge, we have developed 2 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify and predict the construction status for buildings in indicated coordinates and addresses:

1. Pretrained VGG16 model
2. Pretrained and modified ResNet50 model with dropout layers
